# microquant

Introducting microquant! An intuitive quantum simulator that uses only numpy to calculate the state vector.

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [mircograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd), an engine that implements backpropagation with numpy for educational purposes. Microquant implements quantum simulation in a similar vein to qiskit and pennylane, but with numpy exclusively. This education tool gives insight into gate-based quantum simulation of the quantum state vector. This includes implementation of 
- Hadamard
- CNOT
- RX, RY, and RZ

Additionally, there is a version that uses [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to allow for quantum machine learning operations and insights.
