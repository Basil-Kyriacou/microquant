# microquant

Introducting microquant! An intuitive quantum simulator that uses only numpy to calculate the state vector.

Inspired by mircograd, a engine that implements backpropagation with numpy for educational purposes. Microquant implements quantum simulation in a similar vein to qiskit and pennylane, but with numpy.
